You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Always explicitly set `standalone: true` in component decorator
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.

## Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- DO NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use computed() for derived values
- Use effect() sparingly and only for side effects
- Prefer services with signals for shared state

## Services

- Use `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- Mark services as `providedIn: 'root'` when they should be singletons
- Use `readonly` for injected dependencies

## Testing

- Write unit tests with Vitest
- Use `describe` and `it` blocks
- Mock external dependencies
- Test component behavior, not implementation

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix interfaces with descriptive names (not `I`)

## Project Structure

- Group by feature, not by type
- Keep related files close together
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for public APIs
